Fun game for myself and friends. Inspired by Warcaft III's custom map Warlocks.

Because I do not have rights to redistribute all art assets purchased for use in this game, assets are not included
in this repository, and are instead kept in a separate, private repository. Before you can build and run this project, 
you will need to acquire those assets or provide your own replacements. Ask if you believe you should be allowed to
access these assets.

To build, install the latest .net SDK, then `run dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb` to install the monogame content
builder (MGCB).

To run, use `dotnet run` in subfolder corresponding to your operating system (ex. WarlockGame.WindowsDX for windows users)
or you can ask me for a published .exe (can be self-contained if you don't want to install .net runtime).

This project is made without the use of AI tools.
