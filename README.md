Fun game for myself and friends. Inspired by Warcaft III's custom map Warlocks.

To build, install the latest .net SDK, then `run dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb` to install the monogame content
builder (MGCB).

To run, use `dotnet run` in subfolder corresponding to your operating system (ex. WarlockGame.WindowsDX for windows users)
or you can ask me for a published .exe (can be self-contained if you don't want to install .net runtime).

This project is made without the use of AI tools.
